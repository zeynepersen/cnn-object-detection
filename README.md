# CNN Object Detection Project

This project is developed to detect and identify objects in images using various object detection algorithms. The models used in this project include **RetinaNet**, **YOLO v8**, and **YOLOv3** with **OpenCV** for fine-tuning the models to achieve better performance in object detection tasks.

## Technologies Used
- **RetinaNet**: A model known for its effectiveness in detecting objects in challenging environments, especially for minority classes.
- **YOLO v8**: A fast and powerful model optimized for real-time object detection.
- **YOLOv3**: A previous version of the YOLO family, widely used for object detection tasks.
- **OpenCV**: A library for computer vision tasks, used to handle image processing and model inference.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **fine-tuning** existing **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for object detection tasks. The goal is to identify specific objects in images by fine-tuning models such as RetinaNet, YOLOv3, and YOLOv8. The fine-tuning process adjusts the pre-trained models to improve performance on a specific dataset.

- **Fine-tuning**: The process of taking a pre-trained model and adapting it for a specific task or dataset by training it further.
- **Object Detection**: The technique of detecting and identifying objects within images using computer vision methods.
